You can change the deck's view mode by pressing the three dots either in the Decks page or inside the deck itself and then "Edit deck":

<p align="center">
    <img height="200" src="img/faq/edit-from-deck.png"/>
    <img height="200" src="img/faq/edit-from-viewer.png"/>
</p>

<p align="center">

## [I can't reorder some tweets in the deck?](#i-cant-reorder-some-tweets-in-the-deck)

- If a tweet consists of multiple images, they cannot be reordered with each other (the order will reset upon reloading the page).
