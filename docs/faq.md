## [How do I get that Pinterest view like in the README?](#how-do-i-get-the-pinterest-view-like-in-the-readme)

You can change the deck's view mode by pressing the three dots either in the Decks page or inside the deck itself and then "Edit deck":

<p align="center">
    <img height="200" src="img/faq/edit-from-deck.png"/>
    <img height="200" src="img/faq/edit-from-viewer.png"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
    <img width="50%" src="img/faq/edit-deck-modal.png"/>
</p>

There are some quirks with reordering tweets when using Masonry view mode.

- If a tweet consists of multiple images, they cannot be reordered with each other (the order will reset upon reloading the page).

> This is fix-able and is currently in the [TODOs](../README.md#todo).

## [How long did this take to make?](#how-long-did-this-take-to-make)

I got the idea around the end of 2025:

[The first commit was made two days later](https://github.com/nedoxff/favedeck/commit/c92452d414cc7a64933f0bb1d8d5e8184fef5bee), and after that it took about two months to build a MVP, which seems like a reasonable amount of time considering how much testing and reverse-engineering it took.
