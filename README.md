**favedeck** <sup>(stylized in lowercase)</sup> is a browser extension that adds "decking" functionality similar to Pinterest's boards for Twitter bookmarks.

> [!WARNING]
> favedeck is very much in its infancy and hasn't been "battle-tested" so to say. I'd appreciate any sort of feedback and/or contributions!

### Deck tweets

Upon pressing the bookmark button, you'll now be prompted to add the tweet to one or more decks.

> [!NOTE]
> This isn't a requirement; tweets are still bookmarked when you press the button, though you *will* save time by doing the sorting beforehand.

### Organize

The "Bookmarks" page is now the "Decks" page. Here you can view, reorder, and explore the decks you've created.

You can also view all bookmarks as you normally would pressing the "All bookmarks" button, or create new ones by pressing "New deck".

Tweets inside decks can also be reordered, "undecked" (removed from said deck), or added/moved to other decks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are some limitations on how tweets can be re-ordered. [You can read about them here.](docs/faq.md#masonry-reordering)
