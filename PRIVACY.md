# Privacy Policy for favedeck

This extension has access to authorization data used to make requests to Twitter's API, however it is not collected, shared, or processed. All requests to the API are made using Twitter's methods just like the client itself would make them.

No analytics data is collected. The decks are stored locally in IndexedDB and aren't synced with any server, but they can be 
exported to ZIP archives in order to transfer them between devices.
